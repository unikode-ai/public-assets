## Executive Summary

**Base Rate:** $201/night (15% premium over balanced baseline)  
**Projected Monthly Revenue:** $5,200  
**Projected Occupancy:** 63% (19 nights booked)  
**Projected RevPAN:** $173/night

**Target Market:** High-value guests (ASU alumni, families, premium travelers)

### Strategy Rationale
The aggressive strategy prioritizes revenue per available night by setting premium pricing that captures high-willingness-to-pay guests, particularly during ASU football weekends. This approach accepts lower occupancy (63% vs market average 71%) in exchange for significantly higher per-night rates ($273 vs market $141-160).

## Strategy Recommendations

### Tactical Pricing Actions

1. **Set Rates Immediately (By Nov 1)**
   - Upload pricing calendar to PMS/channel manager
   - Implement 2-3 night minimum stays for football weekends
   - Enable instant booking for weekdays, require approval for game weekends

2. **Monitor Booking Pace (Weekly Check-ins)**
   - **Week of Oct 1:** If fewer than 7 bookings secured, consider 5% discount on non-event dates
   - **Week of Oct 15:** If rivalry weekend (Nov 27-30) not booked, hold rates (high-value late bookers)
   - **Week of Nov 1:** Enable last-minute discounts (15% off) for Nov 1-7 gap nights

3. **Dynamic Adjustments**
   - **If occupancy >70% by Oct 20:** Raise rates 10% on remaining availability
   - **If occupancy <55% by Nov 1:** Reduce weekday rates to $180, hold weekend premiums
   - **If game weekends at 100% by Oct 1:** Raise remaining event dates by 15-20%

4. **Revenue Management**
   - Accept 60-65% occupancy as target for aggressive strategy
   - Do not discount below $200/night (maintains premium positioning)
   - Focus marketing on ASU alumni groups, family reunions, high-value travelers

### Risk Mitigation

**Vacancy Risk:** 11 vacant nights projected (37% vacancy rate)
- **Mitigation:** Offer mid-week discounts 7 days before arrival (15% off)
- **Backup Plan:** If occupancy drops below 50%, switch to balanced strategy ($175 base) for December

**Market Sensitivity:** Premium pricing vulnerable to economic downturn or weak ASU season
- **Monitor:** Competitor pricing weekly, adjust if market softens
- **Contingency:** Can drop to balanced strategy rates with 24-hour PMS update

**Review Impact:** Aggressive pricing may attract demanding guests with higher expectation levels
- **Mitigation:** Ensure property is immaculate, provide premium touches (welcome basket, local guides)
- **Target:** 5-star reviews essential to justify premium rates
