## Total Revenue Comparison

| Scenario | Total Revenue | vs Realistic | vs Market ($34K) | Probability | Risk Level |
|----------|---------------|--------------|------------------|-------------|------------|
| **Optimistic** | **$66,068** | **+$8,618 (+15%)** | **+94%** | **20%** | **High** |

## Key Metrics Comparison

### Occupancy Rate

| Scenario | Annual Avg | Peak Season | Shoulder Season | Low Season | Total Nights |
|----------|------------|-------------|-----------------|------------|--------------|
| **Optimistic** | **73%** | 77-82% | 74-76% | 62-64% | **266/365** |
| **Realistic** | **69%** | 73-78% | 70-72% | 58-60% | **252/365** |
| **Pessimistic** | **63%** | 67-72% | 64-66% | 52-54% | **229/365** |

**Occupancy Spread:** 10 percentage points (63% to 73%)  
**Nights Booked Spread:** 37 nights (229 to 266)

**Analysis:** Occupancy variance is relatively narrow compared to revenue variance. This indicates that ADR (average daily rate) has greater impact on revenue uncertainty than occupancy.

### Average Daily Rate (ADR)

| Scenario | Annual Avg | Peak Season | Shoulder Season | Low Season | Premium vs Market |
|----------|------------|-------------|-----------------|------------|-------------------|
| **Optimistic** | **$248** | $330-385 | $160-250 | $145-155 | **+89%** |
| **Realistic** | **$228** | $296-350 | $143-231 | $133-147 | **+74%** |
| **Pessimistic** | **$213** | $275-327 | $134-217 | $128-139 | **+63%** |

**ADR Spread:** $35 ($213 to $248, 16% variance)

**Analysis:** Peak season ADR drives the majority of revenue variance. February optimistic ADR of $385 is 2.9x the August pessimistic ADR of $128.

### Revenue Per Available Night (RevPAN)

| Scenario | Annual Avg | Peak Season | Shoulder Season | Low Season |
|----------|------------|-------------|-----------------|------------|
| **Optimistic** | **$181** | $252-316 | $119-188 | $89-96 |
| **Realistic** | **$157** | $219-275 | $103-163 | $77-84 |
| **Pessimistic** | **$134** | $186-234 | $88-139 | $66-71 |

**RevPAN Spread:** $47 ($134 to $181, 35% variance)

**Analysis:** RevPAN is the best composite metric for scenario comparison, as it accounts for both occupancy and ADR. The 35% RevPAN variance matches the 35% total revenue variance.

| **Low Total** | **$8,625** | **$7,500** | **$6,375** | **$2,250** |

**Low Season % of Total:** 13% (Optimistic), 13% (Realistic), 13% (Pessimistic)

**Key Insight:** Summer accounts for only 13% of annual revenue across all scenarios. Extreme heat is fundamental demand constraint that limits upside even in optimistic scenario.

## Decision Matrix

### If Optimistic Scenario Unfolds

**Indicators to Watch (First 3 Months):**
- Occupancy >75% for Nov-Jan period
- ADR achieving $250+ average
- ASU football team wins >70% of games in 2025 season
- Snowbird booking pace 20% ahead of forecast

**Actions to Take:**
1. Switch to aggressive pricing mid-year (Jan-Feb 2026)
2. Raise base rates 10-15% across all seasons
3. Reduce or eliminate discounts for peak season
4. Increase game weekend premiums to 2.0-2.5x base rate
5. Target premium guest segments (higher income, longer stays)

**Expected Result:** Annual revenue $66,000-70,000 (+15-22% vs realistic forecast)

---

### If Realistic Scenario Unfolds

**Indicators to Watch (First 3 Months):**
- Occupancy 70-75% for Nov-Jan period
- ADR achieving $220-240 average
- ASU football team wins 50-60% of games
- Snowbird booking pace on track with forecast

**Actions to Take:**
1. Maintain balanced strategy as planned
2. Make minor dynamic adjustments (±5-10% based on demand)
3. Offer early bird discounts for advance bookings (90+ days)
4. Focus on review building (target 4.9+ stars, 25+ reviews by Mar 2026)
5. Monitor competition weekly and adjust accordingly

**Expected Result:** Annual revenue $57,000-60,000 (on forecast)

---

### If Pessimistic Scenario Unfolds

**Indicators to Watch (First 3 Months):**
- Occupancy <65% for Nov-Jan period
- ADR below $200 average
- ASU football team wins <40% of games
- Snowbird booking pace 15-20% behind forecast
- New competition enters market (5+ new ASU-proximate listings)

**Actions to Take:**
1. Switch to conservative pricing immediately (reduce rates 10-15%)
2. Offer aggressive discounts (weekly 15%, monthly 20%)
3. Increase last-minute availability (reduce minimum stays)
4. Invest in marketing and visibility (boost Airbnb ads, social media)
5. Focus on cost reduction (negotiate cleaning costs, reduce operating expenses)

**Expected Result:** Annual revenue $48,000-52,000 (-15-18% vs realistic forecast, but still +41-53% vs market average)

## Probability Assessment

### Scenario Likelihood

| Scenario | Probability | Confidence Level | Rationale |
|----------|-------------|------------------|-----------|
| Optimistic | 20% | Moderate | Requires ASU football success AND strong snowbird season AND limited competition |
| **Realistic** | **60%** | **High** | **Most likely outcome based on historical trends and market fundamentals** |
| Pessimistic | 20% | Moderate | Requires multiple negative factors converging (team failure, mild winter, recession) |

**Probability Validation:**
- Tempe STR market has shown consistent 5% growth (supports realistic scenario)
- ASU football typically wins 50-60% of games (supports realistic scenario)
- Snowbird migration has been stable for 10+ years (supports realistic scenario)
- Competition has increased moderately but not dramatically (supports realistic scenario)

### Weighted Expected Value

Calculating weighted average revenue across all scenarios:
- Optimistic: $66,068 × 20% = $13,214
- Realistic: $57,450 × 60% = $34,470
- Pessimistic: $48,833 × 20% = $9,767
- **Weighted Average: $57,451**

The weighted expected value of $57,451 essentially equals the realistic scenario ($57,450), confirming that the realistic scenario represents the statistically most likely outcome.

## Sensitivity Analysis

### Impact of 10% Occupancy Change

| Scenario | Base Occupancy | +10 pts | -10 pts | Revenue Impact |
|----------|----------------|---------|---------|----------------|
| Optimistic | 73% | 83% | 63% | ±$9,000-11,000 |
| Realistic | 69% | 79% | 59% | ±$8,000-10,000 |
| Pessimistic | 63% | 73% | 53% | ±$7,000-9,000 |

**Key Insight:** 10 percentage point occupancy change impacts annual revenue by $7,000-11,000 (12-17% of total revenue). Occupancy optimization is critical.

### Impact of 10% ADR Change

| Scenario | Base ADR | +10% | -10% | Revenue Impact |
|----------|----------|------|------|----------------|
| Optimistic | $248 | $273 | $223 | ±$6,600 |
| Realistic | $228 | $251 | $205 | ±$5,700 |
| Pessimistic | $213 | $234 | $192 | ±$4,900 |

**Key Insight:** 10% ADR change impacts annual revenue by $4,900-6,600 (8-10% of total revenue). ADR optimization has smaller impact than occupancy.

### Most Impactful Variables

1. **Peak season occupancy** (Dec-Mar): 10 pt change = ±$5,000-6,000 revenue impact
2. **Football season ADR** (Sep-Nov): 20% change = ±$3,000-4,000 revenue impact
3. **Snowbird ADR** (Dec-Mar): 15% change = ±$4,000-5,000 revenue impact
4. **Summer occupancy** (Jun-Aug): 10 pt change = ±$1,000-1,500 revenue impact (low leverage)

**Conclusion:** Focus optimization efforts on peak season occupancy and football/snowbird ADR for maximum revenue impact.

## Recommendation

**IMPLEMENT REALISTIC SCENARIO (BALANCED STRATEGY) with monthly monitoring and scenario adjustment triggers.**

**Reasoning:**
1. **60% probability** makes this the most likely outcome
2. **$57,450 revenue** is 69% above market average, demonstrating strong performance
3. **Moderate risk profile** balances revenue and occupancy
4. **Flexible foundation** allows switching to optimistic or pessimistic pricing if indicators warrant

**Monitoring Protocol:**
- Review actual vs forecast revenue/occupancy monthly
- If performance tracks 10-15% above forecast for 2+ months: Switch to optimistic pricing
- If performance tracks 10-15% below forecast for 2+ months: Switch to pessimistic pricing
- Recalibrate assumptions quarterly based on actuals

**Transition Path:**
- **Months 1-3 (Nov-Jan):** Baseline realistic scenario, monitor indicators
- **Months 4-6 (Feb-Apr):** Adjust to optimistic or pessimistic if indicators warrant
- **Months 7-9 (May-Jul):** Recalibrate based on first half performance
- **Months 10-12 (Aug-Oct):** Final adjustments for year-end optimization
