## Tax Analysis Highlights

### Years Generating Tax Losses (2025-2032)

Despite positive cash flow, the property generates tax losses in years 1-8 due to depreciation deduction exceeding net operating income:

| Year | Cash Flow | Tax Loss | Tax Savings |
|------|-----------|----------|------------|
| 2025 | $2,219 | ($1,126) | $321 |
| 2026 | $2,621 | ($1,024) | $292 |
| 2027 | $3,035 | ($910) | $259 |
| 2028 | $3,463 | ($782) | $223 |
| 2029 | $3,904 | ($641) | $183 |
| 2030 | $4,360 | ($485) | $138 |
| 2031 | $4,831 | ($314) | $90 |
| 2032 | $5,318 | ($127) | $36 |

**Total Tax Losses (8 years):** $5,409  
**Total Tax Savings (8 years):** $1,542

### Tax Crossover Point

**Year 2033:** Property begins generating taxable income as operating expenses and declining depreciation no longer fully offset rental income.
