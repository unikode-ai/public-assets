## Depreciation Recapture Analysis

### On Future Sale

When this property is sold, the IRS requires recapture of depreciation previously claimed:

**Depreciation Recapture Tax Calculation:**
- Total depreciation claimed at time of sale: Varies by sale year
- Depreciation recapture rate: **25%** (IRC Section 1250)
- Recapture tax liability: Total depreciation × 25%

**Example: If sold in 2034:**
- Total depreciation claimed: $75,262.50
- Recapture tax: $75,262.50 × 25% = **$18,816**

**Example: If depreciation fully claimed (2039):**
- Total depreciation: $90,315
- Recapture tax: $90,315 × 25% = **$22,579**

### Mitigation Strategies

**1031 Like-Kind Exchange (Recommended):**
- Defer depreciation recapture indefinitely
- Exchange into replacement investment property
- Continue depreciation schedule on new property

**Hold Until Death:**
- Heirs receive step-up in basis to fair market value
- Eliminates depreciation recapture entirely
- Eliminates capital gains tax

**Installment Sale:**
- Spread recapture over multiple years
- Reduces single-year tax hit
- Buyer makes payments over time
