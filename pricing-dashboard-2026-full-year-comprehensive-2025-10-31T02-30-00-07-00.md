## Seasonal Performance Analysis

### Peak Season (Jan-Mar, Dec) - 4 months, 120 days

**Drivers:** Snowbirds escaping winter, Cactus League Spring Training, optimal weather (60-75°F), holiday travel

| Strategy | Peak Revenue | Peak Occupancy | Peak ADR | % of Annual Revenue |
|----------|--------------|----------------|----------|---------------------|
| Aggressive | $31,800 | 72% | $367 | 50% |
| Balanced | $29,200 | 75% | $325 | 48% |
| Conservative | $28,500 | 82% | $290 | 48% |

**Key Insight:** Peak season accounts for 48-50% of annual revenue across all strategies despite being only 33% of year. Snowbird and spring training demand is most significant revenue driver.

**Sources:** Tempe Tourism (peak Dec-Apr), Champion Traveler ($6.3B Jan-Mar AZ travel spending)

### Shoulder Season (Apr-May, Sep-Nov) - 5 months, 151 days

**Drivers:** ASU football (Sep-Nov), graduation (Apr-May), comfortable weather

| Strategy | Shoulder Revenue | Shoulder Occupancy | Shoulder ADR | % of Annual Revenue |
|----------|------------------|-------------------|--------------|---------------------|
| Aggressive | $22,500 | 65% | $235 | 35% |
| Balanced | $21,700 | 71% | $200 | 36% |
| Conservative | $21,100 | 79% | $175 | 36% |

**Key Insight:** Football season (Sep-Nov) generates $15,000-16,000, representing 70% of shoulder season revenue. Without football, shoulder season would underperform significantly.

**Sources:** ASU Athletics 2026 schedule (home opener Sept 5, Big 12 games TBD)

### Low Season (Jun-Aug) - 3 months, 94 days

**Drivers:** Extreme heat (100-115°F), minimal tourism, local traffic, student move-in (late Aug)

| Strategy | Low Revenue | Low Occupancy | Low ADR | % of Annual Revenue |
|----------|-------------|---------------|---------|---------------------|
| Aggressive | $6,800 | 50% | $148 | 11% |
| Balanced | $7,500 | 59% | $138 | 12% |
| Conservative | $7,800 | 66% | $128 | 13% |

**Key Insight:** Conservative strategy wins summer season by capturing price-sensitive local travelers and families. Volume pricing compensates for low per-night rates.

**Challenge:** Summer occupancy drops 15-25 points vs annual average across all strategies. Extreme heat is fundamental demand constraint.

## Annual Financial Projections

### Aggressive Strategy Detailed Breakdown

**Revenue:** $63,600  
**Occupancy:** 66% (241 nights booked)  
**Estimated Operating Costs:**
- Mortgage/Rent: $26,400 ($2,200/month)
- Utilities: $2,400 ($200/month)

**Occupancy:** 71% (259 nights booked)  
**Estimated Operating Costs:**
- Fixed Costs (same as above): $36,600

### Critical Financial Insight

**All strategies show negative NOI due to high per-turnover cleaning costs ($75 × 241-288 turnovers = $18,000-22,000 annually).**

**Solutions to Achieve Profitability:**

1. **Reduce Cleaning Costs:**
   - Negotiate cleaning rate to $50/turnover (saves $6,000-7,200/year)
   - Self-clean during low season (saves $2,000-3,000/year)
   - Target: <$50/turnover average

2. **Increase Length of Stay:**
   - Focus on 7-14+ night stays (reduces turnover frequency)
   - Monthly snowbird bookings (Jan-Mar) = 3 turnovers vs 30 turnovers
   - Target: Average 3-4 night stays vs 1-2 nights

3. **Hybrid Strategy with Monthly Focus:**
   - Jan-Mar: Target monthly rentals (20% discount still profitable)
   - Sep-Nov: Premium football pricing (accept higher turnover)
   - Jun-Aug: Weekly rentals with discount
   - Result: 80-100 total turnovers vs 241-288, saves $10,000-15,000 cleaning costs

4. **Raise Rates Further:**
   - Increase all base rates 10-15% across board
   - Aggressive: $220 base, Balanced: $190 base, Conservative: $175 base
   - Result: +$6,000-9,000 annual revenue

**Revised Profitability Target:**
- Reduce turnovers to ~120/year (avg 3-night stay)
- Cleaning costs: $6,000 (vs $18,000-22,000)
- **Net Operating Income:** +$6,000 to +$9,000 (profitable)
