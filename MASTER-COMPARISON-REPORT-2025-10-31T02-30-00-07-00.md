| Conservative | $158 | $59,400 | 288 | 79% | $206 | $163 | +75% |

**Annual Revenue by Season:**

| Season | Months | Aggressive | Balanced | Conservative | % of Annual |
|--------|--------|------------|----------|--------------|-------------|
| **Peak** | Jan-Mar, Dec | $31,800 | $29,200 | $28,500 | 48-50% |
| **Shoulder** | Apr-May, Sep-Nov | $22,500 | $21,700 | $21,100 | 35-36% |
| **Low** | Jun-Aug | $6,800 | $7,500 | $7,800 | 11-13% |

**Key Annual Insights:**
1. **Peak season (4 months) = 50% of annual revenue** - Snowbirds and spring training are critical
2. **Football season (Sep-Nov) = 25% of annual revenue** - ASU proximity maximizes game weekend premiums

## Strategy Selection Framework

### When to Choose AGGRESSIVE ($201 base)

**Best For:**
- Revenue maximization priority
- Established properties (4.9+ stars, 25+ reviews)

- Highest RevPAN ($173-201)
- Captures premium guest willingness-to-pay
- Best margins if operating costs controlled

**Cons:**
- Lowest occupancy (63-66%)
- Highest vacancy risk (124 vacant days/year)
- Vulnerable to market downturns
- May attract more demanding guests

**Annual Revenue:** $63,600  
**Best Use Case:** Established property maximizing profit

---

### When to Choose BALANCED ($175 base)

**Best For:**
- Optimal risk-adjusted returns
- Year 1 operations building reputation
- Steady cash flow priority
- Broad guest demographic appeal

**Pros:**
- Matches market occupancy (71%)
- 93-95% of aggressive revenue with 5-8 pts higher occupancy
- Predictable performance
- Faster review accumulation vs aggressive

- "Middle of the road" positioning

**Annual Revenue:** $60,400 (95% of aggressive, +78% vs market)  
**Best Use Case:** Year 1-2 operations, sustainable long-term strategy

**RECOMMENDED STARTING STRATEGY**

---

### When to Choose CONSERVATIVE ($158 base)

**Best For:**
- Occupancy maximization
- New properties (<10 reviews) building momentum
- Risk-averse ownership
- Lender occupancy requirements
- Summer months (Jun-Aug)

**Pros:**
- Highest occupancy (79-80%)
- Lowest vacancy risk (77 vacant days/year)
- Most bookings = fastest review accumulation
- Recession-resistant (value positioning)
- Wins summer season

**Cons:**
- Lowest revenue ($59,400, 93% of aggressive)
- Lowest per-night rates ($198-225)
- Highest cleaning costs (288 turnovers/year)
- Hard to raise rates after establishing low baseline
- Attracts more price-sensitive guests

**Annual Revenue:** $59,400 (93% of aggressive, but 79% occupancy)  
**Best Use Case:** New properties, off-season months (Jun-Aug), high-volume approach

---

## Hybrid Strategy Recommendations

### Optimal Annual Approach (Advanced)

**Maximize revenue by using different strategies for different seasons:**

| Season | Months | Strategy | Base Rate | Why |
|--------|--------|----------|-----------|-----|
| Peak | Jan-Feb-Mar | AGGRESSIVE | $201 | Snowbird/spring training premium |
| Shoulder | Apr-May | BALANCED | $175 | Maintain occupancy, reasonable rates |
| Low | Jun-Jul-Aug | CONSERVATIVE | $158 | Capture summer volume |
| Shoulder | Sep-Oct-Nov | AGGRESSIVE | $201 | Football season premium |
| Peak | Dec | AGGRESSIVE | $201 | Snowbird return |

**Hybrid Annual Revenue:** $61,500 (102% of pure balanced, 97% of pure aggressive)  
**Hybrid Occupancy:** 70% (1 pt below balanced, 4 pts above aggressive)  
**Result:** Best of both worlds - captures peak premiums while maintaining shoulder/low occupancy

**Implementation:** Requires quarterly pricing calendar updates and dynamic monitoring

---

## Critical Financial Analysis

### Operating Cost Reality Check

**All strategies show NEGATIVE net operating income when accounting for typical turnover costs:**

| Strategy | Revenue | Turnovers | Cleaning @$75 | Other Costs | Total Costs | NOI |
|----------|---------|-----------|---------------|-------------|-------------|-----|
| Aggressive | $63,600 | 241 | $18,075 | $47,340 | $65,415 | -$1,815 |
| Balanced | $60,400 | 259 | $19,425 | $48,160 | $67,585 | -$7,185 |
| Conservative | $59,400 | 288 | $21,600 | $48,110 | $69,710 | -$10,310 |

**Problem:** High per-turnover cleaning costs ($75 × 241-288 = $18,000-22,000) consume 28-36% of revenue.

### Path to Profitability

**Solution 1: Reduce Cleaning Costs**
- Negotiate cleaning to $50/turnover (saves $6,000-7,200/year)
- Self-clean during low season (saves $2,000-3,000/year)
- **Result:** NOI improves by $8,000-10,000 → profitable

**Solution 2: Increase Average Length of Stay**
- Target 7-14 night stays (reduces turnovers)
- Focus on monthly snowbird bookings (Jan-Mar)
- Offer weekly discounts to incentivize longer stays
- **Result:** Reduce turnovers from 241-288 to ~120-150, saves $10,000-15,000 cleaning costs

**Solution 3: Raise Rates 10-15%**
- Aggressive: $220 base, Balanced: $190 base, Conservative: $175 base
- **Result:** +$6,000-9,000 additional revenue

**Recommended Approach:** Combination of all three
- Negotiate cleaning to $50/turnover
- Target avg 3-4 night stays (vs 1-2 nights)
- Raise base rates 10% across board
- **Result:** NOI of +$6,000 to +$12,000 (profitable)
