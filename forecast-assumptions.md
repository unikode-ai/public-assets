## Key Assumptions

### Base Case (Realistic Scenario)

#### Occupancy Assumptions

| Season | Occupancy Rate | Basis | Confidence |
|--------|----------------|-------|------------|
| **Peak (Dec-Mar)** | 73-78% | Historical balanced strategy average from pricing dashboards | High |
| **Shoulder (Sep-Nov, Apr-May)** | 70-72% | Market average (71%) with slight seasonal adjustment | High |
| **Low (Jun-Aug)** | 58-60% | Historical summer performance due to extreme heat | High |
| **Annual Average** | 69% | Weighted average across all seasons | High |

**Justification:** Occupancy rates derived directly from existing pricing dashboard data for balanced strategy, which represents realistic market performance. Annual average of 69% is slightly below 71% market average due to forecast period starting mid-shoulder season (November) rather than peak season (January).

**Uncertainty:** ±5 percentage points. Actual occupancy could range 64-74% depending on demand fluctuations.

#### ADR (Average Daily Rate) Assumptions

| Season | ADR Range | Basis | Confidence |
|--------|-----------|-------|------------|
| **Peak (Dec-Mar)** | $296-350 | Balanced strategy rates with snowbird/spring training premiums | High |
| **Shoulder (Sep-Nov, Apr-May)** | $143-231 | Balanced strategy rates with football event premiums | High |
| **Low (Jun-Aug)** | $133-147 | Balanced strategy rates with summer discounts | High |
| **Annual Average** | $228 | Weighted average across all seasons | High |

**Justification:** ADR values directly from balanced strategy in pricing dashboards. Peak season commands 1.3-1.5x multiplier due to snowbird and spring training demand. Football season commands 1.5-1.6x multiplier on game weekends. Summer requires 0.75x multiplier due to heat constraints.

**Uncertainty:** ±$20. Actual ADR could range $208-248 depending on competitive pricing dynamics.

#### Revenue Growth Assumptions

| Growth Factor | Annual Rate | Basis | Confidence |
|---------------|-------------|-------|------------|
| **Market Growth** | 5% | Tempe STR market trend (AirROI.com) | Moderate |
| **ADR Inflation** | 3% | CPI for lodging | High |
| **Blended Growth** | 5% | Conservative blend of market and inflation factors | Moderate |

**Justification:** 5% annual growth is conservative compared to historical Tempe market performance (5-8% recent years). Accounts for market maturation and increased competition.

**Uncertainty:** Growth could range 2-8% depending on economic conditions and competitive dynamics.

### Optimistic Scenario (+15% Revenue)

#### Assumptions

1. **Occupancy:** 73% annual average (+4 pts vs realistic)
   - Peak: 77-82%, Shoulder: 74-76%, Low: 62-64%
   - Driven by: Strong ASU football season (8+ wins), robust snowbird demand (harsh northern winter)

2. **ADR:** $248 annual average (+9% vs realistic)
   - Peak: $330-385, Shoulder: $160-250, Low: $145-155
   - Driven by: Aggressive pricing capturing premium guest willingness-to-pay

3. **Revenue Growth:** 8% annually
   - Driven by: Market acceleration, limited new competition, premium brand positioning

4. **Market Conditions:**
   - ASU football team exceeds expectations (Big 12 championship contender)
   - Harsh winter drives record snowbird migration from Canada and Midwest
   - Tempe STR market growth accelerates to 8% (vs 5% baseline)
   - Property achieves 4.9+ star rating with 50+ reviews by mid-year

#### Probability: 20%

**Reasoning:** Requires multiple positive factors to converge simultaneously. Historical precedent exists (strong football years like 2007, 2013, 2019 showed similar demand spikes), but not typical outcome.

### Pessimistic Scenario (-15% Revenue)

#### Assumptions

1. **Occupancy:** 63% annual average (-6 pts vs realistic)
   - Peak: 67-72%, Shoulder: 64-66%, Low: 52-54%
   - Driven by: Weak ASU football season (3-9 record), mild winter reduces snowbird demand

2. **ADR:** $213 annual average (-7% vs realistic)
   - Peak: $275-327, Shoulder: $134-217, Low: $128-139
   - Driven by: Competitive pressure from new listings, economic downturn

3. **Revenue Growth:** 2% annually
   - Driven by: Market slowdown, increased competition, conservative pricing

4. **Market Conditions:**
   - ASU football team underperforms (fan interest collapses)
   - Mild winter keeps snowbirds at home (reduced migration)
   - Economic recession impacts discretionary travel spending (-10-15%)
   - 5-10 new ASU-proximate STRs enter market, compressing rates

#### Probability: 20%

**Reasoning:** Requires multiple negative factors to converge. Historical precedent exists (weak football years, recession years), but property's ASU proximity provides downside protection.

## Critical Assumptions Affecting Accuracy

### Assumption 1: ASU Proximity Premium Maintained (+75-87%)

**Current Evidence:** Property's 1-mile proximity to Mountain America Stadium justifies 75-87% revenue premium over Tempe market average ($60,400 vs $34,000).

**Assumption:** This premium is sustained throughout 12-month forecast period.

**Risk:** New listings closer to ASU could erode premium. However, property has unique amenities (backyard, bikes) that provide differentiation.

**Impact if Wrong:** If premium erodes to +50%, annual revenue would decline to $51,000 (-11% vs forecast).

### Assumption 2: No Major Property Changes or CapEx

**Assumption:** Property condition remains consistent, no major renovations or capital expenditures required.

**Risk:** Major repairs (HVAC failure, roof damage, appliance replacement) could force closures or reduce guest satisfaction.

**Impact if Wrong:** 10-day closure for repairs = $2,000-3,000 revenue loss. Extended closure (30+ days) = $7,000-10,000 loss.

### Assumption 3: Cleaning Costs Remain Manageable

**Current Challenge:** Cleaning costs of $18,000-22,000/year (28-36% of revenue at 241-288 turnovers and $75/turnover) threaten profitability.

**Assumption:** Cleaning costs can be reduced to <$50/turnover AND average stay length increased to 3-4 nights (reducing annual turnovers to 120-150).

**Impact if Wrong:** If cleaning costs remain at $75/turnover with 252 turnovers (realistic scenario), total cleaning = $18,900 (33% of revenue). Combined with other operating costs, this produces negative NOI.

**Critical Success Factor:** Cost management is essential for profitability.

### Assumption 4: Review Rating Maintained or Improved

**Current Status:** Property needs to achieve and maintain 4.9+ star rating with growing review count.

**Assumption:** Property maintains 4.9+ stars throughout forecast period, accumulates 25+ reviews by Mar 2026, 50+ reviews by Dec 2026.

**Risk:** Single poor review or operational failure could drop rating below 4.8, reducing algorithm visibility and bookings.

**Impact if Wrong:** Rating drop to 4.7 stars could reduce occupancy 5-10 percentage points ($5,000-10,000 revenue impact).

### Assumption 5: Competition Growth Moderate

**Current Market:** 1,453 active STR listings in Tempe.

**Assumption:** Net new supply increases 3-5% annually (45-75 new listings), distributed across Tempe.

**Risk:** If 5-10 new listings open within 1-mile radius of ASU, competitive pressure could compress rates 10-20%.

**Impact if Wrong:** 15% ADR compression = $8,600 annual revenue loss.

## Seasonal Assumptions

### Peak Season (Dec 2025, Jan-Mar 2026)

**Primary Drivers:**
1. Snowbird migration from Canada and Midwest (escaping winter)
2. Cactus League Spring Training (February-March)
3. Optimal weather (60-75°F daytime)
4. Holiday travel (Christmas, New Year's)

**Occupancy Assumption:** 73-78% (5-7 pts above annual average)

**ADR Assumption:** $296-350 (+30-54% above annual average)

**Supporting Evidence:**
- Tempe Tourism data: $6.3B Jan-Mar Arizona travel spending
- Historical dashboard data: Peak season accounts for 48-51% of annual revenue
- Snowbird Advisor: Canadian migration driven by weather differential (Phoenix 70°F vs Toronto 20°F)

**Uncertainty Factors:**
- Mild winter in Canada/Midwest reduces snowbird demand (probability: 25%)
- Spring training games rescheduled or cancelled (probability: 5%)
- Economic recession reduces discretionary travel (probability: 20%)

### Shoulder Season (Nov 2025, Apr-May, Sep-Nov 2026)

**Primary Drivers:**
1. ASU football home games (Sep-Nov): 6-8 games expected in 2026
2. ASU graduation (late April)
3. Comfortable weather (70-85°F)

**Occupancy Assumption:** 70-72% (1-3 pts above annual average)

**ADR Assumption:** $143-231 (-37% to +1% vs annual average)

**Supporting Evidence:**
- ASU Athletics: 2026 home games confirmed Sep 5, Sep 19; additional Big 12 games TBD
- Historical dashboard data: Football season generates 36% of annual revenue
- Q4 2025 dashboard: November 2025 balanced strategy projects $4,850 revenue

**Uncertainty Factors:**
- ASU football team performance (3-9 record vs 8-4 record impacts demand by ±30%)
- Big 12 conference game schedule (home vs away distribution uncertain for 2026)
- Graduation timing (early vs late April affects booking concentration)

### Low Season (Jun-Aug 2026)

**Primary Drivers:**
1. Extreme heat (100-115°F daytime)
2. Local traffic only (Phoenix metro residents, family visits)
3. ASU student move-in (late August boost)

**Occupancy Assumption:** 58-60% (9-11 pts below annual average)

**ADR Assumption:** $133-147 (-42% to -36% below annual average)

**Supporting Evidence:**
- Champion Traveler: Summer is lowest tourism season for Phoenix due to heat
- Historical dashboard data: Summer accounts for only 11-13% of annual revenue
- Conservative strategy wins summer (higher occupancy, lower rates)

**Uncertainty Factors:**
- Extreme heat events (115°F+ heat waves reduce demand further)
- Local economic conditions (Phoenix metro recession impacts local travel)
- Student move-in timing (early vs late August affects booking concentration)

## Forecast Methodology

### Revenue Calculation Formula

For each month:

```
Monthly Revenue = Base Monthly Revenue × (1 + Growth Rate)^Years × Seasonal Index × Scenario Multiplier
```

Where:
- **Base Monthly Revenue:** Average monthly revenue from historical data ($5,033 for balanced strategy)
- **Growth Rate:** 5% annually for realistic scenario
- **Years:** Fraction of year from forecast start (e.g., 0.08 for Nov 2025 if baseline is Jan 2026)
- **Seasonal Index:** Month-specific multiplier (1.49 for Jan, 0.48 for Aug)
- **Scenario Multiplier:** 1.15 for optimistic, 1.0 for realistic, 0.85 for pessimistic

### Occupancy Calculation Formula

For each month:

```
Occupancy Rate = (Nights Booked / Days in Month) × 100%

Nights Booked = Monthly Revenue / ADR
```

Where:
- **Monthly Revenue:** Calculated per above formula
- **ADR:** Average daily rate for that month and scenario

### RevPAN Calculation Formula

```
RevPAN = Monthly Revenue / Days in Month
```

Revenue Per Available Night (RevPAN) is the composite metric combining occupancy and ADR.

   - Compare actual revenue vs forecasted revenue
   - Compare actual occupancy vs forecasted occupancy
   - Compare actual ADR vs forecasted ADR
   - Calculate variance percentage (±%)
   - Identify drivers of variance (demand higher/lower, rates higher/lower, events impact)

2. **Quarterly Calibration (End of Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4)**
   - Recalculate seasonal indices based on actual results
   - Update growth rate assumption (market trends, competitive landscape)
   - Adjust scenario probabilities based on indicators (football performance, snowbird booking pace)
   - Generate revised 12-month rolling forecast

3. **Annual Re-Forecast (Every October)**
   - Complete new 12-month forecast for following November-October period
   - Incorporate full year of actual results into assumptions
