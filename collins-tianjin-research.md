## Executive Summary

Goodrich Aerospace Technologies (Tianjin) Co., Ltd. (GATT) and Goodrich Aerostructures Service (China) Co., Ltd. (GASCH) are wholly-owned Collins Aerospace (RTX) subsidiaries operating in Tianjin Airport Economic Area, China. Established in 2009, GATT manufactures non-acoustic composite nacelle components for A320neo and other programs ($27.3M capital), while GASCH provides nacelle MRO services for A320/A330/A350/B737/B757/B787 aircraft (170,000-200,000 sq ft, ~350 employees). Both facilities are strategically positioned in Tianjin Free Trade Zone, directly across from the Airbus A320 Final Assembly Line, enabling GATT to serve as a complete engine assembly (podding) supplier to Airbus.

Key customers include Airbus Tianjin FAL (OEM), Sichuan Airlines (MRO), HNA Aviation Group (MRO), and 20+ undisclosed airline customers covering ~500 aircraft. Products are classified under HS 8803.30 (aircraft parts), subject to US Section 301 tariffs (List 1) with select exclusions through May 2025. GASCH holds FAA Part 145 certification (33BY496B); CAAC Part-145 status uncertain. Recent geopolitical developments create significant risks: RTX incurred $200M penalties for 750 ITAR violations (2017-2023, majority from Collins), China imposed sanctions on RTX (Feb 2023), and US-China tariff escalation reached 145% (April 2025). However, GATT/GASCH benefit from proximity to expanding Airbus operations (capacity doubling to 8 aircraft/month) and Tianjin FTZ tax incentives.

- Diversification of customer base outside China

**Current Status:** Sanctions announced (Feb 2023) but limited enforcement to date on commercial aerospace operations

#### 7.2.3 Tariff Cost Escalation Risk (HIGH)

**Category:** Financial / Cost
**Likelihood:** High (Section 301 tariffs active, potential for further increases)
**Impact:** Medium (margin pressure, pricing disadvantage)

**Drivers:**
- Section 301 tariffs (25% on HS 8803)
- Exclusions expiring May 2025
- Potential for further tariff increases (145% scenario)

**Triggers:**
- Expiration of exclusions without renewal
- US-China trade war escalation
- Loss of Civil Aircraft Agreement protections

**Mitigations:**
- Apply for tariff exclusions (renewed annually)
- Pass costs through to customers where possible
- Consider relocation of OE manufacturing outside China
- Optimize supply chain to minimize tariff exposure
- Leverage FTZ benefits to offset costs

**Current Status:** Operating under 25% Section 301 tariffs with select exclusions through May 2025

### 7.3 Opportunity Assessment

#### 7.3.1 Airbus Tianjin Expansion Opportunity (HIGH VALUE)

**Category:** Strategic positioning / Market access
**Likelihood:** High (Airbus announced capacity doubling)
**Impact:** High (revenue growth, preferred supplier status)

**Drivers:**
- Airbus Tianjin FAL capacity doubling to 8 aircraft/month (from 4/month)
- Second final assembly line opening
- Geographic proximity (facility directly across street)
- Existing supplier relationship for podding work

**Strategic Value:**
- GATT positioned as complete engine assembly supplier
- Logistics efficiency (truck delivery, short lead times)
- Potential for expanded scope (additional A320 family components)
- Long-term revenue visibility tied to Airbus production

**Competitive Advantage:**
- No other nacelle supplier as close to Airbus Tianjin FAL
- Safran Nacelles nearby but serves different engine variant (LEAP-1A)
- Established relationship since 2009

**Revenue Potential:**
- Airbus doubling capacity = doubling podding work volume
- 8 aircraft/month = 96 aircraft/year (up from 48/year)
- Estimated value: $50K-100K per aircraft podding work = $4.8M-9.6M annual increase

**Current Status:** Active supplier, positioned for expansion

#### 7.3.2 MRO Market Growth Opportunity (MEDIUM VALUE)

**Category:** Market expansion
**Likelihood:** Medium (dependent on Asia-Pacific air traffic recovery)
**Impact:** Medium (incremental revenue growth)

**Drivers:**
- Asia-Pacific air traffic recovery post-pandemic
- Aging fleet requiring more MRO (A320ceo, B737NG)
- 20+ existing service agreements with growth potential

**Strategic Value:**
- Recurring revenue from MRO agreements
- Customer diversification across airlines
- Aftermarket higher margin than OE

**Competitive Position:**
- GASCH one of few nacelle MRO providers in Asia with FAA Part 145 cert
- Competition from Singapore, Hong Kong MRO facilities
- CAAC Part-145 status (if obtained) would strengthen position for China-registered aircraft

**Current Status:** 500 aircraft under MRO agreements, potential for growth with HNA deal (Feb 2024)
