## Strategy Recommendations

### Why Choose CONSERVATIVE?

1. **Review Building:** 24 bookings/month generates reviews 25% faster than aggressive strategy (19 bookings)
2. **Cash Flow Consistency:** 80% occupancy provides predictable monthly revenue
3. **Low Vacancy Risk:** Only 6 vacant nights reduces revenue volatility
4. **Competitive Resilience:** Lower rates maintain bookings during market downturns
5. **Guest Mix:** Attracts more families and repeat visitors (vs high-maintenance luxury seekers)

### When to Use

**Ideal Scenarios:**
- **New Property (<10 reviews):** Need review momentum for algorithm visibility
- **Competitive Market:** Multiple ASU-proximate properties competing for same guests
- **Risk-Averse Owner:** Prefers steady 80% occupancy over revenue maximization
- **Lender Requirements:** Mortgage covenants requiring minimum occupancy thresholds
- **Off-Season Positioning:** Summer months (Jun-Aug) when aggressive pricing fails

### Performance Targets

**Success Metrics:**
- Achieve 80%+ occupancy consistently
- Build to 25+ reviews within 3 months
- Maintain 4.8+ star average rating
- Generate $4,750+ monthly revenue

**Warning Signs (Switch Strategy):**
- If occupancy exceeds 90%: Raise rates 10-15% (leaving money on table)
- If average rate drops below $190: Property undervalued, switch to balanced
- If reviews plateau at <4.5 stars: Quality issues, not pricing issues

## Comparison to Other Strategies

| Strategy | Base Rate | Revenue | Occupancy | RevPAN | Trade-off Analysis |
|----------|-----------|---------|-----------|--------|-------------------|
| Aggressive | $201 | $5,200 | 63% | $173 | +$450 revenue, -17 pts occupancy |
| Balanced | $175 | $4,850 | 70% | $162 | +$100 revenue, -10 pts occupancy |
| **CONSERVATIVE** | **$158** | **$4,750** | **80%** | **$158** | **Baseline (max occupancy)** |

**Trade-off:** Give up 2-9% revenue for 10-17 pts higher occupancy
- **Worth it if:** Building reviews, need consistent bookings, risk-averse
- **Not worth it if:** Established property (25+ reviews), strong market demand, profit maximization goal
